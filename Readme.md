Brain Tumor Detection App
Developed a tumor detection application that classifies brain tumors into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The app utilizes TensorFlow for image classification with tmImage for pre-processing and model inference. The applicationâ€™s front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading and viewing results of the prediction. The back-end is powered by Flask, with a connected database to store user data and tumor detection results.

Key features include:
- Image classification: Uses TensorFlow to classify medical images of brain scans into one of four tumor categories.
- Web interface: Allows users to upload medical images and view results through a clean and responsive design.
- Database integration: Stores user and image data for later retrieval
